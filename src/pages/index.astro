			Welcome to my corner of the internet! Iâ€™m Akinkunmi. I have a passion for solving problems by building impactful software.
<br> <br>
			I'm constantly learning new stuff from docs, YouTube videos, blogs and every possible medium I can find information. <br>	
			<q>My goal is to become as cracked of an engineer as I can be.</q> <br> <br>
			
			I'm currently working on a new framework - <a href="http://destino.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destino</a>.
			<br> <br>
			You'll mostly find me working within the Typescript/JavaScript ecosystem, but I'm also interested in other languages such as <i>Elixir</i>, <i>Rust</i>, and <i>Go</i>.
